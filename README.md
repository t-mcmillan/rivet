# Rivet
Rivet is an in developement python script for [Obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md) that links editable pdf notes together using.  
I am designing this script to be used in conjunction with a note taking app like GoodNotes 6. The user will be able to upload their editable handwritten notes and rivet will find references in the notes and link said pdf to other relevant notes in the Obsidian Vault. This way the user can visualize all their interconnected notes in Obsidian's graph view, facilitating studying and reviewing.  

**This is a personal project and therefore tailored to my needs. However the repository can be cloned and modified by anyone to suit their requirements.**
